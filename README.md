Project Description:

Screenshots: 

Usage Instructions:
- Press the '+' button to add a task
- Add a title to the task
- If no title is added you cannot save the task and an error will appear on screen prompting you to add a title.
- Click on 'Cancel' if you want to cancel adding a new task

Features Implemented:
- Add a new task
- Save a new task
- Edit a new task to delete

Future Enhancements:
- Enhance user experience with a better look
- Persistence of data
- Alerts when trying to delete tasks

Challenges and Solutions: 
- Implementing everything together at first was a bit overwhelming but slowly understanding how everything works together and how seamless Swift makes the implementation of the ViewModels, Models, and Views.

Reflection
- It was a nice increment in difficulty from the initial calculator console app, and it wasnt overwhelmingly difficult either. It took a bit to understand how everything works together but after a while having the preview of the app on the side helps immensely since you can see in real time what is happening and not having to press build all the time helps with time and trying to figure out where you went wrong. The errors that appeared for me were a bit confusing at first but after doing research and seeing where I went wrong helped a lot.
